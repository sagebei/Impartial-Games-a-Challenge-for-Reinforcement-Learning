## Impartial Games - A Challenge to Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains all the python scripts used in the experiments of this paper, which are organized in the folders as following:

* **value networks**: includes the codes used in section *5.1 Model parity function using value networks*. 
* **policy networks**:  includes the codes used in section *5.2 Learn winning moves using policy networks*
* **reinforcement learning**: includes the codes used in section *7. Reinforcement learning on for nim*
* **example**: includes the codes and experiment setup for the example 2 in section *4. Different level of mastery*

### Notes on using our codes:
* To run and replicate our results, please refer to our paper for the experiment configurations. The trained models are stored in the **model** folder. The name of the model files reflexs the board size of the nim they were trained on. For example, the file named **5heaps** is the model for the 5 heaps nim. 
* We support conducting analysis on specifed nim positions on 5, 6 and 7 heaps using trained models. The results on running the analysis on the initial position of a 5 heap nim are shown below.
